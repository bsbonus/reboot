A tool to discover new things. Built as an experiment with angular.

The goal is to build a simple interface that would aggregate a variety of events happening near me in Los Angeles. 
Partly driven by personal reasons to try some new things, it's mainly an experiment with angular, grunt/bower and bootstrap.

Short term, I'm looking to use the Meetup and Eventbrite APIs to populate the map. Longer term, I'm considering web-scraping 
with a cron job. I also should probably connect it to some kind of backend I control, like a Rails backend, so I can 
control the responses to be more useful to my needs.
